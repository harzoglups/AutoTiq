# AutoTiq

**Never miss your Fairtiq check-in again!**

AutoTiq is an Android application that automatically launches the Fairtiq app when you approach your saved transit points. It wakes your phone, vibrates, and displays Fairtiq on your lock screen - making it impossible to forget to start your journey before boarding the train.

## 🎯 Why AutoTiq?

Forgetting to check-in with Fairtiq before boarding public transport can result in a fine for an honest mistake. AutoTiq solves this problem by:

1. **Detecting when you approach** your saved train/bus stations
2. **Waking your phone screen** even if locked
3. **Vibrating to get your attention** (configurable, default: 3 bursts)
4. **Automatically opening Fairtiq** so it's the first thing you see
5. **No manual intervention needed** - it works completely in the background

This way, you'll never forget to start your journey in Fairtiq, avoiding unnecessary fines for simple oversights.

## 🔧 Development

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for detailed development documentation.

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for AI agent development guidelines.

## 🚀 Releases

This project uses **fully automated semantic versioning** based on conventional commits.

### How It Works 🤖

1. **Write commits** using conventional commit format
2. **When ready for a release**:
   - **Option A**: Go to Actions → "Auto Release" → Click "Run workflow" 
   - **Option B**: Push a tag: `git push origin v1.0.0`
3. The workflow automatically:
   - Analyzes all commits since last release
   - Determines the correct version bump (major/minor/patch)
   - Builds the APK
   - Creates the GitHub release

**You control WHEN to release, the workflow decides WHAT version.**

### Creating a Release

#### Method 1: Manual Trigger (Recommended)

1. Go to **Actions** → **Auto Release**
2. Click **"Run workflow"**
3. Select branch: `main`
4. Click **"Run workflow"**

The workflow analyzes your commits and creates the appropriate version automatically!

#### Method 2: Push a Tag

```bash
# The tag value doesn't matter - it will be ignored
git tag v0.0.0
git push origin v0.0.0
```

The "Build and Release on Tag" workflow will trigger and create the correct version.

### Version Bump Rules

The version is determined by analyzing your commit messages:

| Commit Type | Version Bump | Example |
|-------------|--------------|---------|
| `feat:` | **MINOR** (0.X.0) | `feat(map): add marker clustering` |
| `fix:` | **PATCH** (0.0.X) | `fix(location): resolve GPS issue` |
| `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` | **MAJOR** (X.0.0) | `feat!: redesign entire API` |
| `docs:`, `refactor:`, `chore:` | **PATCH** (0.0.X) | `docs: update README` |

**Priority**: MAJOR > MINOR > PATCH. If you have both `feat:` and `fix:` commits, you'll get a MINOR bump.
